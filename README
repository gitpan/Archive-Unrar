DESCRIPTION

Archive::Unrar is a procedural module that provides manipulation (extraction and listing of embedded information) of compressed RAR format archives by interfacing with the unrar.dll dynamic library for Windows.

It uses two functions : list_files_in_archive and process file

The first one lists details embedded into the archive (files bundled into the .rar archive,archive's comments and header info) and the latter extracts the files from the archive.

list_files_in_archive takes two parameters;the first is the file name and the second is the password required by the archive.
If no password is required then just pass undef or the empty string as the second parameter

process_file takes four parameters;the first is the file name, the second is the password required by the archive, the third is the directory that the file's contents will be extracted to and the fourth dictates if a directory will created with the
same as name as the archive (Map directory to archive name).
If no password is required then just pass undef or the empty string as the second parameter

process_file returns $errorcode and $directory.If $errorcode is undefined it means that
the function executed with no errors. If not, $error_code will contain an error description.
$directory is the directory where the archive was extracted to

	($errorcode,$directory)=process_file($file,$password);
	print "There was an error : $result" if defined($result);

list_files_in_archive returns $errorcode

	$errorcode=list_files_in_archive($file,$password);
	print "There was an error : $result" if defined($result);
