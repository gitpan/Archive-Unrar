Archive::Unrar - is a procedural module that provides manipulation (extraction and listing of embedded information) of compressed RAR format archives by interfacing with the unrar.dll dynamic library for Windows.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Archive::Unrar;
	
	Usage without password :
	list_files_in_archive($file,undef);
	process_file($file,undef); 

	Usage with password :
	list_files_in_archive($file,$password);
	process_file($file,$password); 
	list_files_in_archive("c:\\input_dir\\testwithpass.rar","mypassword");
	process_file("c:\\input_dir\\testwithpass.rar","mypassword"); 
	
	If archive in the same directory as the caller :
	list_files_in_archive("testwithpass.rar","mypassword");
	process_file("testwithpass.rar","mypassword"); 
	
	Absolute path if RAR archive is not in the same directory as the caller :
	list_files_in_archive("c:\\input_dir\\testwithpass.rar","mypassword");
	process_file("c:\\input_dir\\testwithpass.rar","mypassword"); 
		
	Optionally, provide output directory;
	if directory does not exist then it will be automatically created
	if output directory is not provided then the file is extracted in the same directory the caller :
	process_file("c:\\input_dir\\testwithpass.rar","mypassword","c:\\output_dir"); 
	process_file("c:\\input_dir\\testnopass.rar",undef,"c:\\output_dir"); 
		
	Optionally, provide Selection :
	If Selection equals ERAR_MAP_DIR_YES then 'Map directory to Archive name'
	process_file("c:\\input_dir\\testwithpass.rar","mypassword","c:\\output_dir",ERAR_MAP_DIR_YES); 
		
	If Selection<>ERAR_MAP_DIR_YES then 'Do not Map directory to Archive name'
	process_file("c:\\input_dir\\testwithpass.rar","mypassword","c:\\output_dir",undef); 
		

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Archive::Unrar is a procedural module that provides manipulation (extraction and listing of embedded information) of compressed RAR format archives by interfacing with the unrar.dll dynamic library for Windows.

It exports two functions : explicitly list_files_in_archive and by default process_file

The first one lists details embedded into the archive (files bundled into the .rar archive,archive's comments and header info) and the latter extracts the files from the archive.

list_files_in_archive takes two parameters;the first is the file name and the second is the password required by the archive.
If no password is required then just pass undef or the empty string as the second parameter

process_file takes five parameters;the first is the file name, the second is the password required by the archive, the third is the directory that the file's contents will be extracted to. The fourth dictates if a directory will created (pass ERAR_MAP_DIR_YES) with the
same as name as the archive (Map directory to archive name). The last one refers to a callback,optionally.
If no password is required then just pass undef or the empty string as the second parameter
Function prototype :  ($file,$password,$output_dir_path,$selection,$callback)

process_file returns $errorcode and $directory.If $errorcode is undefined it means that
the function executed with no errors. If not, $errorcode will contain an error description.
$directory is the directory where the archive was extracted to :

($errorcode,$directory)=process_file($file,$password);
print "There was an error : $errorcode" if defined($errorcode);

list_files_in_archive returns $errorcode
$errorcode=list_files_in_archive($file,$password);
print "There was an error : $errorcode" if defined($errorcode);

Version 2.0 includes support for custom callback while processing of files (line 312 : $callback->(@_) if defined($callback))
For an example of its usefulness take a look at : L<http://sourceforge.net/projects/unrarextractrec/>
The Unrar_Extract_and_Recover.pl script uses a callback (my $callback=sub { $gui::top->update() }) for allowing the updating of GUI events while the process_file function of Unrar.pm is engaged into extracting the file (which is a long running activity), so the GUI is more responsive, minimizes the 'freezing' time and most importantly allows Pausing while the file is being processed/extracted

=head2 Version 2.0 Notes

Version 2.0 is a mature release - major update/rewrite. Upgrading to this version is strongly recommended. 

fixes runaway pointer bug which could result in random hangs;in previous versions the cleanup/pointer deallocation 
was left up to the caller of the module which would lead to issues like runaway pointers. Now the module deallocates
pointers by itself making it self-contained
fixes some incorrect mappings between Perl and dll's C structures
better error checking
some optimizations
using constants for error description
added support for custom callback while processing file (line 312 : $callback->(@_) if defined($callback))

=head1 PREREQUISITES

Must have unrar.dll in %SystemRoot%\System32.

Get UnRAR dynamic library for Windows software developers at L<http://www.rarlab.com/rar/UnRARDLL.exe >

This package includes the dll,samples,dll internals and error description 

=head2 TEST AFTER INSTALLATION

After module is installed run test\mytest.pl.
If all is well then you should see two files in the current directory :
test no pass succedeed.txt
test with pass succedeed.txt

A file 'test with pass succedeed1.txt' inside newly created directory 'c:\output_dir' 

A file 'test with pass succedeed2.txt'  newly created directory 'c:\output_dir\testwithpass2' which demonstrates the usage of constant ERAR_MAP_DIR_YES

=head2 EXPORT

process_file function and most error description constants, by default.
list_files_in_archive explicitly.
