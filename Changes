optionaly enter output directory where file will be extracted to

%donotprocess hash keeps track of all encrypted header chained archives.
Only the first part of the chain is processed and thus there is no need 
to process the rest of the parts individually in the case the module 
is used by client code that loops over the archives. 
Encrypted header archives require special handling and by using this hash their processing becomes more efficient.

Get UnRAR dynamic library for Windows software developers at http://www.rarlab.com/rar/UnRARDLL.exe
This package includes the dll,samples,dll internals and error description 

After downloading place dll in %SystemRoot%\System32 directory

"mytest.pl" includes test that checks for dll's existence 

Revised documentation

Analyzes the encoding/transcoding principles which the module follows
