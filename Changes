Fixed bugs :

	* $errorcode=ERAR_ENCR _WRONG_PASS;
	  There was a space in the "ERAR_ENCR_WRONG_PASS" which causes the module to die in case 
	  an incorrect password is specified.

	* fixed issue "could not list the contents of password protected archives"
      when calling 'list_files_in_archive' function
