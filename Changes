%donotprocess hash keeps track of all encrypted header chained archives.
Only the first part of the chain is processed and thus there is no need 
to process the rest of the parts individually in the case the module 
is used by client code that loops over the archives. 
Encrypted header archives require special handling and by using this hash their processing becomes more efficient.

some optimizations
